  - work out what a base application context should look like - so without the
    msp specific stuff that came with it, but still able to support those sorts
    of things (whatever they are)

  - There are constants that probably should be initialized instead (look at
    resource/base.rb) - maybe base could be created with a class builder as each
    application may want different options for resources
