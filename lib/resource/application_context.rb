module MSP::Resource2
  # A kind of a service locator / hub / factory providing various facilities for resource-related
  # stuff which is used throughout the whole routing tree of resources.
  #
  # If that sounds a bit handwavey and global, it's probably because it is; feel free to split up
  # if you can find a better more localised way of doing this.
  #
  # Also: the aim is to change Doze so the Doze::Application can be
  # used as a context object like this, and so routing blocks get passed
  # an environment object with access to this doze-application-level context
  # and other things, rather than just a session.
  #
  # For now though, we're manually creating it and passing it around as a
  # separate object.
  #
  # The main global things it helps with at present are: constructing wrapper resources for models
  # in a generic way which 'knows' about all the ways it's possible to construct resources which expose
  # models via routing chains like so:
  #   RepositoriesIndex -> '/Repository -> Object::WrappedModel
  # Also, providing access to the TypeIndex, which gives all serializers some knowledge about the
  # type resources which can be linked to to provide browsable metadata about the types of objects.
