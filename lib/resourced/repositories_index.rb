# RepositoriesIndex serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it's an index resource which routes
# to a bunch of different repository resources for under specified aliases.
#
# But it's also a kind of service locator or factory for repository resources and the object
# resources within them, which helps find an appropriate repository resource for a given model
# class, or an appropriate Object::WrappedModel resource for a given model instance (going via
# the relevant repository resource).
#
# The application-wide ApplicationContext object depends on all available RepositoriesIndex
# and uses them to provide a centralised facility for this kind of service location.
#
# Some assumptions are made here, namely that your Repository resources will expose the model instances
# returned from the repository after wrapping in an Object::WrappedModel resource subclass.
#
# Room for change: the responsibilities could be split up a bit, it could be generalised a bit
# so it doesn't make as many assumptions, some of the service-locator/factory stuff could maybe be done
# via Wirer instead at the cost of having to add a load more things into the main wirer application.
